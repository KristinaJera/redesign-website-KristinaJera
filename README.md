HOW I HAVE WORKED WITH AGILE METHOD:
Unfrtunately i had a problem with the github link and i couldn't make the sprints as they should be, and push every step that i have done in github. 
But i worked on my own and created my own way with agile method in this project. 
At first i designed a low fidelity design, and then a high fidelity design. After that i started with coding and making my design real.
The first coding, i used it as a basic code which remained untached, while i made a clone of it in an other folder to continue the coding further. 
Everytime that i had errors i knew it that i should go back to my basic one and check it up. That helped me to every step i did, saving every time, and having everytime a new basic folder. So i didn't loose my previews coding, or get lost on any errors!
